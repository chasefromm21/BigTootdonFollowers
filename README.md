# BigTootdonFollowers

FULL source code (and .deb files for installation via SSH/AFC2, or iFile or Filza apps available in Cydia) of the BigTootdonFollowers that shows up 5747 Mastodon followers if anyone cares. Only for iOS 8 and above and Tootdon app.

Enables a decently-sized follower amount of 5474. Obviously for looks and play. Basically like TrollTwitter for Mastodon but ONLY for faking follower stats, and not for faking following stats or faking out how many toots you've posted.

Also, how come the large number, specifically for 5747 followers? Because it's just so easy to remember... easy peasy...
